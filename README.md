### About the App
* Browse through a list of Marvel's the ten most recently updated characters and events from the comics and stories, both on desktop and mobile. The page for characters would display the characters' names, descriptions (if available), and two of their comics. The page for events would display the events' titles and descriptions. The user would use the search bar if there is something a specific character name or event title they would like to find. The user would use the links in the navigation bar to switch between the home page, the page with the characters' data, and the page with the events' data.

Also, does at least one of the following:
1. Use a dropdown menu to display characters that have available descriptions and characters that do not have an available description
2. Include a like button add or remove certain characters or events to a favorites list and an unlike button to remove them from the favorites list.
